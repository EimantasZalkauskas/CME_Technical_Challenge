Test Execution Questions:
    1. In general, you run a test and it fails. What is the first thing you do?

    A: First check log files of application where failure occured and deduce what caused the issue,
        if that doesn't solve the problem run application in debug mode with breakpoints around the line
        where the failure occured and figure out what functionality is breaking. 

    2. What are five high level possible reasons for a test failure in an end-to-end integration
        environment?
    
    A:  - Entry with ORDER_ID not added to Order Table
        - Entry with TRADE_ID not added to Fill table after order is filled 
        - Ack with correct ORDER_ID not sent back to the user 
        - User order filled at current price not contract price 
        - User not receiving fill message with TRADE_ID
    
    3. A user enters an Order to buy 100 units of Contract A @ $100 each but does not receive an
        ACK. What troubleshooting steps would you take?
    
    A: First thing will be to check the order flow between user / router and router / engine to make sure 
        the order information has reached the engine.
        If order information is recieved then I will check if an ORDER_ID is being generated and an entry is 
        being added to the DB. 
        Lastly I would track the ack with the ORDER_ID going back to the user to see if a failure is occuring 
        in the engine or router on the way back.  
    
    4. A user enters an Order to buy 100 units of Contract A @$100 each, the ACK and Fill are both
        received but the other WAN users do not receive this information. What troubleshooting
        steps would you take?
    
    A: If the user has received both ACK and Fill confirmation the only place there could be a problem 
        is with the DB writes or reads. I would first check the logs to make sure both entries to the Order and Fill
        tables were successful. If so I would go into the DB and make a query call for that ORDER_ID and make sure 
        all information is as expected, followed by the same procedure using TRADE_ID for the Fill table.
        If everything is correct I would check the code in the engine for reading the information from the DB  
        and sending it to the gateway to make sure it is functioning as intended.


Database Questions:

    1. Show the total count of ENGINEID that have had Fills.

    A: SELECT count(Router.ENGINEID) FROM Router
        INNER JOIN Fill ON Router.ROUTERID = Fill.ROUTERID;

    2. Update Column 'OrderDate' in Fill and Order tables for Orders and Fills where date is 'March
        22nd 2014' and time is between 10:02:00hrs and 10:10:00hrs ----> 'March 26th 2014' and
        time 10:14:00hrs. 

    A: UPDATE Order,Fill
        SET Order.OrderDate = '2014-03-26 10:14:00',
            Fill.OrderDate = '2014-03-26 10:14:00'
        where Order.OrderDate >= '2014-03-22 10:02:00' and
            Order.OrderDate <= '2014-03-22 10:10:00';

    3. Pull all records that exist for both Order and Fill tables.

    A: SELECT * FROM Order o
       JOIN Fill f
       ON o.ORDID = f.ORDID
